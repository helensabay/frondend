A better plan (battle-tested pattern)

1. Order lifecycle (state machine)

New → Accepted (throttled) → In Prep (per item)
Item sub-states: Queued → Firing → Cooking (timer) → Hold/Delay → Item Ready.

Assemble (bag/plate) → Staged (shelf position) → Handoff (scanned) → Completed/Voided.

Allow Partial Ready and Re-fire at item level. Keep an audit log with staff/station stamps.

2. Kitchen Display System (KDS) by station

Auto-route items by tags (Grill, Fry, Salad, Bar, Dessert).

Each station shows only its items, with cook timers, color aging, and sound alerts.

Expo screen aggregates items by order, waits for “all items ready,” then prompts assemble.

3. Smart batching & firing

Batch identical items within a rolling window (e.g., 60–120s) respecting cook times and capacity.

Fire sequencing: long-cook items auto-start first; sides/eggs fired JIT to finish together.

Make-to-stock cues for high-volume SKUs during peak.

4. Capacity-aware quoting & throttling

Track station capacity and WIP; automatically set/adjust promised times shown to guests.

Throttle acceptance from channels (walk-in, web, delivery) when a station saturates.

5. Visibility & control for the floor

Queue shows ETA / countdown, aging color bands, and late badges.

Filters: channel, status, station, item, allergen, late>2m, VIP.

Bulk actions: start/ready multiple, re-print, recall. Keyboard shortcuts for speed.

Search by code/name/last 4 digits.

Shelf positions (A1, B3) with big labels for pickup racks.

6. Handoff accuracy

Auto-generate pickup codes / barcodes; scan at handoff to mark Completed.

Show guest name + item highlights and require 2-point verification for delivery couriers.

7. Reliability & edge cases

Offline queue with local persistence & printer failover.

Voids/Refunds/Remakes tie back to item-level causes.

Allergen & modifiers are prominent at every station.

Split orders (serve what’s ready, hold the rest) with clear receipts.

8. Metrics that matter (on the manager dashboard)

Prep time by item & station, On-time %, average lateness, remake rate, handoff errors, station utilization, top bottlenecks, and forecast vs actual.

Quick UI sketch (what staff should see)

Row = Order with ETA countdown, channel icon, customer name/code, and aging color.

Tap to expand: items grouped by station, each with its own status/timer.

Action chips: Fire long-cook, Batch 3 fries, Hold, Mark item ready, Assemble, Stage shelf B2, Handoff (scan).

Top bar: filters, search, late toggle, and Now/Next view (what should be cooking this minute).

Implementation hints

Use a message bus (e.g., Redis streams) for real-time updates across devices.

Model the workflow as a finite state machine per item and per order.

Maintain station queues with capacity & cycle-time estimates to drive ETAs.

Persist an immutable event log for audit and metrics.

TAKE NOTE: NO NEED TO OVER-ENGINEER THIS PLAN.
