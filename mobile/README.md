# Sanaol Mobile App (Expo)

Cross-platform Expo Router application for the Sanaol canteen. The app targets two primary personas (staff handling day-to-day orders and managers supervising operations) and integrates with the REST backend exposed under `/api/*`.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Expo SDK 54 (React Native 0.81, React 19)
- **Navigation:** Expo Router (with React Navigation hooks)
- **Styling:** NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **State & Storage:** React Context, AsyncStorage
- **APIs & Auth:** Axios, Expo Auth Session (Google), Expo Local Authentication, Expo Camera
- **Animation & UI:** React Native Reanimated, Moti, Lucide React Native, Expo Linear Gradient

## Styling Guidelines

- `src/styles/nativewind.js` configures `NativeWindStyleSheet` and is imported once from `src/app/_layout.js`. Do not remove this import; NativeWind classes depend on it.
- Tailwind tokens live in `tailwind.config.js`. Use the semantic color names (`bg-primary-500`, `text-neutral-700`, `bg-surface-muted`, etc.) instead of raw hex values. Extend the same file if new tokens are required.
- Prefer `className` props over `StyleSheet.create`. When dynamic classes are needed, use the helper in `src/styles/cn.js` to compose conditional class strings.
- Shared primitives (buttons, cards, list rows) should export Tailwind-ready APIs so downstream screens avoid duplicating styling logic.
- Any legacy `StyleSheet` usage you touch during feature work should be migrated to NativeWind utilities.

## Role-Based Feature Access

The following modules are implemented or planned in the UI. Use this matrix when enabling or hiding functionality per role:

### Account Management

- **Staff:** Login / Logout, Edit Password, Edit Information, Biometric Login (Face Scan)
- **Manager:** Same capabilities as Staff

### Inventory Management

- **Staff:** View Stock Levels, Update Stock Levels, Track Expiry Dates
- **Manager:** All Staff actions plus Manage Menu Items, Send Low Stock Alerts, Manage Restocking Schedule

### Order Handling

- **Staff:** Place Order, View Order Status, Handle Order Queue, Update Order Status, Track Bulk Order Progress
- **Manager:** Handle Order Queue, Update Order Status, Track Bulk Order Progress

### Payment & Transactions

- **Staff:** Process Cash / Online Payment, View Order History, View Payment Records
- **Manager:** All Staff actions plus Process Refunds

### Staff & Work Scheduling

- **Staff:** View Profile and Assigned Roles, View and Edit Shift Schedule
- **Manager:** All Staff actions plus Manage Attendance Records, Manage Leave Records

### Reports & Analytics (Manager Only)

- View Sales Reports (Daily / Monthly), Inventory Reports, Order & Transaction Reports, Staff Attendance Reports, Customer Purchase History

### Notifications

- **Staff:** Send Updates / Notifications, Receive Notifications, View Notifications
- **Manager:** Same capabilities as Staff

## Prerequisites

- Node.js **18.x** (Expo SDK 54 is compatible with Node 18 or 20; avoid 22 for now)
- npm **10.x** (ships with Node 18) or pnpm 9 if you prefer, but the repo contains an npm lockfile
- Git
- Expo CLI: you can work with `npx expo` (recommended) or install globally with `npm install --global expo@latest`
- Android Studio (with an emulator) and/or Xcode for native builds; Expo Go on a physical device works for development
- Watchman (macOS) for faster file watching

## Installation & Onboarding

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd mobile
   ```
2. **Install JavaScript dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Install missing peer dependencies (required for navigation and gesture support)**
   ```bash
   npx expo install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack react-native-gesture-handler @react-native-masked-view/masked-view
   ```
   These packages are present in `package-lock.json` but not declared in `package.json`, so reinstalling them keeps the dependency graph explicit.
4. **Ensure React Native Reanimated is configured**
   - Add `"react-native-reanimated/plugin"` as the last entry in `babel.config.js > plugins` (required for Moti and animations).
   - If it is already present, no change is needed.
5. **Review the NativeWind global stylesheet**
   - `metro.config.js` references `./global.css`, which is already checked in with the Tailwind base/components/utilities directives.
   - Extend this file if you need custom utilities.
6. **Configure environment values** by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and updating the values (see "Local Configuration" below).
7. **Verify the toolchain**
   ```bash
   npx expo doctor
   ```
8. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run start         # starts Expo in Metro dev mode
   npm run android       # build & run on Android (requires emulator or device)
   npm run ios           # build & run on iOS (macOS + Xcode)
   npm run web           # run in a browser
   ```

## Local Configuration

### API Base URL

- Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env` (or your shell) to the backend origin, e.g. `http://192.168.0.10:8000` for LAN testing.
- The client automatically prefixes `/api/v1`; avoid trailing slashes in the environment variable.

### Authentication Tokens

- Access and refresh tokens are stored in AsyncStorage under `@sanaol/auth/accessToken` and `@sanaol/auth/refreshToken`. The cached profile lives at `@sanaol/auth/user`.
- If you need to clear the session during development, run `expo start -c` or manually wipe those keys via the device inspector.

### Google OAuth

- Provision OAuth client IDs in Google Cloud (one per platform) and expose them to Expo via environment variables:
  ```bash
  EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_EXPO_CLIENT_ID=<Expo Go client ID>
  EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=<Android native client ID>
  EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=<iOS native client ID>
  EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=<Web client ID - optional fallback>
  ```
- `src/app/login.jsx` reads these values at runtime; when absent, the "Continue with Google" button stays disabled.
- Add the Expo redirect URIs (`https://auth.expo.io/@<account>/<project>` for Expo Go, plus native scheme `mobilecapstone://`) to the OAuth consent screen.

### Biometric & Camera Permissions

- Face scan features rely on `expo-local-authentication` and `expo-camera`.
- Physical devices are required to test camera & biometrics; simulators will skip or mock these flows.

### Styling

- NativeWind is already wired through `tailwind.config.js` and `metro.config.js`. Update `global.css` to add or tweak utility classes as needed.

## Integration Points

- **Auth REST API (`src/api/api.js`):**
  - `POST /api/auth/login` (expects `{ email, password }` -> returns `{ success, message, role, email }`)
  - `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`
  - `POST /api/auth/register`
- **Menu Management:**
  - `GET /api/menu/` fetches menu items.
  - `POST /api/menu/` creates new menu entries (Manager only).
- **Payment:**
  - `POST /api/payments/confirm` with `{ orderId, method }`.
- **Async Storage Keys:**
  - `userEmail`, `userRole`, (optional) `accessToken`, `refreshToken`.

Verify your backend implements these endpoints or adjust the client accordingly. When expanding functionality (e.g., bulk orders, scheduling), follow the same pattern inside `src/api/api.js`.

## Available npm Scripts

- `npm run start` - Launch Expo development server.
- `npm run android` - Build and run the native Android app.
- `npm run ios` - Build and run the native iOS app (macOS only).
- `npm run web` - Run the project in a web browser.
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint across the `src` directory.
- `npm run format` - Check Prettier formatting (Tailwind plugin included).
- `npm run test` - Execute Jest/RTL test suite.

## Known Gaps & Follow-Up Tasks

- `@react-navigation/native` and peers are not listed in `package.json`. Reinstall them (see step 3) and commit the updated manifest to avoid future install drift.
- `react-native-reanimated` requires the Babel plugin; add it to prevent runtime warnings (`TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Reanimated.default')`).
- Several source comments contain mojibake characters due to encoding; re-save files with UTF-8 to clean them up.
- `src/utils/auth.js` still points to `https://reqres.in` as a mock API. Either update it to use your production backend or delete the helper to avoid confusion.

## Troubleshooting

- **Metro cannot resolve `./global.css`:** Ensure the file stays in the project root and rerun `expo start -c` if Metro cached an old bundle.
- **Animations or Moti components crash:** Ensure the Reanimated Babel plugin is configured and rebuild the app (`expo start -c`).
- **Network calls fail on device:** When testing over LAN, replace the local IP in `BASE_URL` with your machine's IP address reachable from the device, or use Expo tunnels (`npx expo start --tunnel`).
- **Google Sign-In redirect loops:** Call `WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession()` (already included) and confirm your OAuth redirect URI matches the Expo project slug.

## Developer Onboarding Checklist

- [ ] Install dependencies and verify with `npx expo doctor`.
- [ ] Configure API endpoints and credentials.
- [ ] Run the app on at least one physical device to validate camera/biometric flows.
- [ ] Review role-based modules to ensure UI visibility matches Staff vs Manager permissions.
- [ ] Document any additional dependencies you introduce (update `package.json`, `README.md`).

Happy shipping!
